### 🤖 About Me:
Some say I have an unhealthy obsession with AI. My goal? To make machines understand us—or at least pretend convincingly. I fine-tune models, push the limits of AI, and sometimes argue with neural networks like they’re sentient (they’re not… yet). 

When I'm not making AI smarter, I’m probably debugging something that was working *just fine* five minutes ago.

📍 **What I Do:**  
* Machine Learning & AI Research  
* Natural Language Processing (because making machines "understand language" is my thing)    
* Fine-tuning models until they question their existence  

🏆 **Bragging Rights:**  
* Youngest **Certified AI Professional** by Microsoft  
* AI & ML expertise recognized on a global scale  
* Worked on cool projects at **Microsoft, Castus Technologies**, and more  
* Co-founded multiple startups/projects

### 💻 Tech Stack:
🔹 **Programming:** Python, C++, Java, C (yes, I enjoy pain)  
🔹 **ML Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Keras, Transformers
🔹 **Data Science:** NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn
🔹 **Cloud & DevOps:** Azure, AWS, GCP 
🔹 **Other:** Linux (because Windows updates are terrifying), Arduino (because why not)

🚀 **Fun fact:** The AI models I build may one day take over the world, but for now, they mostly just misinterpret sarcasm. Let’s connect!
